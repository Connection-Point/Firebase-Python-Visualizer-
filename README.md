# Firebase-Python-Visualizer-
This is a test case model for firebase data visualizer for python programming languages. The idea came accross my mind as i was looking at the real time database with GUI. I don't know whether it works or not but lets give it a try since its only a prototype for this. Feel free to commit to the repo :)
